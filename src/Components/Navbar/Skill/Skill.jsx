            <p>Born an African on the 21st of April. I grew up to become a software 
                engineer and an Artificial Intelligence developer because of their
                relevance in the real world. Software engineering has always been 
                a carreer I wanted to explore because of how it solves real life 
                problems. I know I can't boast that I'm a problem solver now because 
                you probably are just hearing about me for the first time, but then you can click
                any of the links on this site to findout more about how tue that is.
