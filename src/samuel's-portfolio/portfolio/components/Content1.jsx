              Bible Echo - Desktop Application

                  Bible Echo is an innovative desktop application designed to revolutionize how churches and religious gatherings display scripture during live services. Built as part of my final-year project at the University of Ghana, this solution leverages AI-driven speech recognition to capture spoken Bible references in real-time and instantly project the corresponding verse on a secondary display. The goal was to minimize manual intervention, streamline media operations, and create a seamless worship experience for both technical teams and congregants.

                  The system was developed using React with Vite for the frontend, Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive UI, and a Flask backend integrated with OpenAIâ€™s Whisper model for offline speech transcription. A structured KJV Bible database powers the verse lookup functionality, ensuring accurate and efficient retrieval of scripture references. Additionally, the application supports multi-display projection, live verse editing, and a user-friendly interface for media teams to override or queue content when needed.

                  This project not only demonstrates my technical expertise in full-stack development and AI integration, but also showcases my ability to translate a real-world problem into a production-ready solution. Bible Echo reflects my passion for building impactful, user-centric applications and my ability to work end-to-end on complex systems, from architecture design and database modeling to frontend development, testing, and deployment.
